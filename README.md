# INTERFACE_GROUP_7
 A documentation on various Python interfaces and their workability
## TKINTER
Tkinter is a customizable, widget oriented framework that offers a host of commonly used elements. 
The frame provides a structure to your application.
Buttons are used for taking input from the user.
Checkbuttons are used for making selections.
Labels are used for displaying textual information.
File dialogs are for uploading or downloading files to/from the application .
## KIVY
The framework is a mix of Python, Cython. It is an open source Graphical User Interface frameworkfor building intuitive user interfaces encompassing multi-touch applications that implement Natural User Interface. it enables designers to code once and deploy the code to multiple platforms. The built-in support for OpenGL ES 2 allows them to use modern and powerful graphics and design techniques.
Kivy has also been used in Android and iOS applications and in Linux, Windows interfaces.
## wxPYTHON
A Python extension module that acts as a wrapper for the wxWidgets API. It allows developers to create native user interfaces that add zero additional overhead to the application. it has crossplatform capabilities that enable it to be deployed widely.
the latest update includes PyPI which is easy to download and sue as an extension.
### Tkinter and PyPI for Pygame will be used in this project
# Tkinter interface for retreaving .java files and checking for correct nesting
The interface imitates a file explorer system. It opens the window and allows the user to choose .java files from the files stored in the computer. After the file has been selected, it is then passed through the attached brackets checker code for errors.
# Pygame framework for baseball scorekeeping
The interface allows a scorekeepe to record the scores of the various teams that have played the game. it computes the total score and puts it in a list. the interface has buttons to allow for recording of scores and submit button for saving.
